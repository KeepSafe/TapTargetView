## Guidelines for contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing! We're always happy to get the community involved in our projects, however we have just a couple rules that we enforce for any pull requests:

  - You must follow the code style already in place
  - You must use meaningful commit messages

Any pull request that does not meet the above criteria will not be merged.
